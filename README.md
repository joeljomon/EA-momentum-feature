# EA-momentum-feature
This serves as an add on to the EA college football game, which composes of a crowd momentum feature based on varied gameplay.


# Feature Proposal

Overview:
Introduce a "Crowd Momentum Meter" feature that visually and audibly reflects how much influence the home crowd has during gameplay. This dynamic system would shift based on in-game events like touchdowns, turnovers, and big plays, creating a more immersive and realistic college football atmosphere.

Value Statement:
College football is known for its intense fan involvement and rowdy stadium environments. By adding a Crowd Momentum Meter, we can better simulate the emotional highs and lows of a real college game. This feature increases immersion, gives players feedback on their performance, and adds a layer of strategy—especially in away games—where silencing the crowd becomes part of the challenge.

Solution:
The meter appears as a dynamic HUD element at the top of the screen and fluctuates based on gameplay events (e.g., touchdowns = +20%, sacks = +10%, turnovers = +25%, penalties = -10%). When the home team’s meter is full, the crowd becomes overwhelmingly loud, making audibles harder for the opposing team to execute (similar to past NCAA games). Visual shake effects and muffled sound cues could be triggered to simulate player disorientation. The system builds on existing audio and HUD frameworks, requiring only additions to event listeners and crowd sound modulation logic.

Evaluation Statement:
This feature adds realism and intensity without needing complex new mechanics. It leans on existing gameplay systems and enhances the emotional impact of home-field advantage. A “reduced effects” toggle can be included in settings for players sensitive to visual or audio overload. The Crowd Momentum Meter helps bridge gameplay and atmosphere, emphasizing the unique spirit of college football.
